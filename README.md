Empirical investigation of the effect of module size on software maintainability for Python software systems

Analyzing Code with Pylint
This report outlines the process of analyzing code within directories using Pylint, a Python static code analysis tool, and interpreting the generated results.

1. Setting Up the Environment
Install Pylint:

Bash
pip install pylint


Navigate to the Target Directory:

2. Running Pylint Analysis
Execute Pylint:

Bash
pylint <directory>

Pylint will scan the directory and its subdirectories for Python files, analyzing their code quality.

3. Interpreting the Results
Pylint's output displays various metrics and codes throughout the terminal window. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

Overall Score: Represented as a number between 0 and 10 (with 10 being the best), this score indicates the overall code quality based on Pylint's findings.
Message Codes: These codes (e.g., C0301, W0611) represent specific findings categorized by Pylint. The letter prefix indicates the category (e.g., C for convention, W for warning, E for error).
Descriptions: Pylint provides a brief description for each message code, explaining the potential issue identified.
Line Numbers: The line numbers within the code files where Pylint identified the issues are specified.
Example Output:

************* Module <module_name>.py
************* score=8.2
.. (several lines of output omitted for brevity) ..
C0301  Line too long (83/79 characters) (too-many-lines)
In this example:

The module <module_name>.py received a score of 8.2.
Pylint identified an issue with line length exceeding the recommended limit (C0301).
4. Addressing the Issues
By reviewing the message codes, descriptions, and line numbers, we can pinpoint areas in our code that require improvement. Utilize Pylint's suggestions to enhance code readability, maintainability, and overall quality.
